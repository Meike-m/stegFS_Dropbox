Contributions on top of the existing project [stegfs](https://github.com/albinoloverats/stegfs). 

Stegfs is a steganographic file system available for Linux and based on the construction proposed by [Anderson/Needham/Shamir](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/stego-fs.pdf). 

This project adds some features that increase security/privacy (like 2FA) and usability (a layer that manages access to the hidden files). The current implementation lacks both and is vulnerable to a few attacks we could mitigate with our implementation on top.
